# Simple Todo App

Easily add tasks, check them off as you complete them, and remove them when you’re done. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, this website helps you keep track of what matters most—without any clutter.

## Functionality

This to-do list web app is designed to help users manage daily tasks with ease and simplicity. It provides an intuitive interface where users can quickly add, check off, and remove tasks in real time — all without unnecessary distractions.

### Core Features

# Add New Tasks

- Users can type a new to-do item into an input field and add it with a single click or press of the Enter key.

- Each new item instantly appears in the task list below.

- Mark Tasks as Complete

- Each task includes a checkbox that allows users to mark items as completed.

- Completed tasks are visually distinguished (e.g., with a strikethrough or faded color) to show progress at a glance.

## Delete Tasks

- Users can easily remove tasks they no longer need with a delete button next to each item.

- Once deleted, the task is immediately removed from the list.

### Responsive Design

- The app layout adapts to any screen size, making it easy to use on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices.

## Technology

- This to-do list web app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology for clean and maintainable styling. The project applies Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to organize functionality into reusable classes and methods. It also leverages JavaScript modules with import/export to separate logic across multiple files — ensuring scalability, readability, and efficient code management.
